This is a demonstration of use of timers in Javascript.
Uses Bootstrap for simple styling.
Uses jQuery for DOM manipulation.
Numbered questions are declared as global object-containing arrays.
The quiz progresses sequentially through 25 questions, dynamically displaying question data on the page.
Each answer choice is dynamically tagged with a "corr" attribute that can be read with jQuery to determine if the answer was correct.
The page will respond differently for right and wrong answers and for timeouts.
Final score is shown at the end of the quiz, and user may click a button to try again.
See the Cheat Sheet text file for answers.
